In the robots.txt file, we also saw a folder named .hidden.
We then tried to download its content via the wget command but there was too many README file with small sentences.
Our guess was that one of the files contained a clue for finding the flag (or in this case the flag itself)
so we created a script that searched for an expression with digits and letters like an md5 hash

We finally found the flag in the file 'README.15794'

To prevent this, protect your folders with a .htaccess file
