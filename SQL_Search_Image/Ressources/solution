In the image search page, you can see an image by typing a number in the text field.

you then get fields like ID, Title and URL.

I tried to get all informations with an UNION and a request after:

1 UNION select table_name, column_name FROM information_schema.columns

Then I have all of the DB architechture and I cmd+f to find interestings keywords.

There was a table named list_images with a "comment" column wich was interesting.

I then requested:

1 UNION select id, comment from list_images

wich lead me to this comment "If you read this just use this md5 decode lowercase then sha256 to win this flag ! : 1928e8083cf461a51303633093573c46"

I searched google with the md5 code and found that it was "albatroz"

I then hashed albatroz with sha256 and got the flag

To prevent this, check the sql query by using a "prepare" function
