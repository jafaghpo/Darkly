We downloaded a chrome extension named EditThisCookie and found that there was a cookie named I_am_admin with an md5 hash value.
So we used a md5 decryption website to find the initial value and found 'false'
Considering the name of the cookie, we replaced its value by the md5 hash of 'true' and saved it

To prevent this, don't store admin session in cookies and use HTTPS instead of HTTP
